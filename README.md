# _pn_RTOS-From-Scratch-master
This project implements an RTOS from scratch in C, featuring task scheduling, context switching, delays, and basic synchronization. It demonstrates how low-level kernel components work on embedded systems, offering a clean, modular, and educational foundation for RTOS development.
